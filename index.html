        A croissant is crescent shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough. The
        dough is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded several
        times in a process called lamination. The final dough is cut into
        triangles and rolled into a crescent shape.The process of lamination
        results in a layered, flaky textured roll, more like puff pastry. The
        main ingredients in a croissant are flour, yeast, salt, sugar, milk,
        water, eggs and butter. A well baked croissant should be flaky and crisp
        on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. It should be evenly
        baked and well aerated.
